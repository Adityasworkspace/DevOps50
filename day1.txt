SDLC: Software Develoment life cycle
1. requiremnt analysis 
2. Planning 
3. Design 
4. Code
5. Deploy
6. Maintainence & Monitor


Methodologies:

1. Waterfall ---  (it follows step by step approach)
                \
                  ---
                      \
                        ---
                            \
- Good for small projects, where project requirement is clear.
- non custamizeable
- customer feedback not involved in between project running.
- it is not possible & difficult to change requirement once project is completed.


2. Agile (flexible) 

- in which divides bigger task into smaller parts.
- customize feedback is necessary.

3. DevOps

- combination of two teams development & operations
- it helps to fasten the software deliver process


What is DevOps?
DevOps is a combination of Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) that helps automate and integrate software development and IT operations. It aims to improve collaboration, increase deployment speed, and enhance reliability.

Key Concepts in DevOps:
1. CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment) – Automating code integration, testing, and deployment.
2. Version Control (Git, GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) – Tracking code changes.
3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) (Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation) – Managing infrastructure using code.
4. Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) – Packaging and running applications consistently.
5. Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack) – Keeping track of system health.
6. Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) – Hosting applications on the cloud.



DevOps tools :

1. git (source code management)
2. docker (containerization platform) 
3. k8s  (container management tool)
4. terraform (IAC tool)
5. Jenkins (CICD pipeline)
6. datadog (monitoring)
